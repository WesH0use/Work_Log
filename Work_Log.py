# User should, if she choses to enter a new work log, be able to provide a task name,  number of minutes spent working on it, and any additional notes
# If user wants to find a previous entry they should be presented with four options: find by date, find by time, find by exact search, find by pattern (more details instructions)

# Users should be able to find all of the tasks that were done on a certain date
# Users should be able to match a search string (regex or plain text search)
# Print a report of this information onto the screen, including date, title of task, time spend and general notes
